Here's a simple step-by-step summary of the information gathering phase in cybersecurity: 

1. Start with WHOIS Lookup: Use WHOIS lookup to gather essential details about the target's IP address, domain name, technologies, server specifications, and company information.
2. Retrieve Domain Information: Collect information like email contacts, domain creation date, IP address, IP location, domain status, and details about the web server software (e.g., Apache) version.
3. Analyze Privacy Settings: Check if the domain uses privacy protection, which may hide specific details such as company addresses.
4. Identify Web Server and OS: Note the web server software (e.g., Apache), its version (e.g., 2.20.31), the operating system (e.g., UNIX), and any additional add-ons (e.g., mod SSL, open SSL).
5. Explore Hosting Providers: Identify the hosting provider (e.g., Dim Enough Dot Net) to understand more about their services and infrastructure.
6. Analyze Name Servers: Note the name servers being used, as they can provide insights into hosting and infrastructure providers.
5. This process aids in understanding the target's digital presence, technology stack, and potential areas for security assessment or exploitation.
